This is a text document that describes some hopefully good game ideas, outside of Minecraft!
If you find this and you can make any of these come true, PLEASE do. I can't program myself but would love to see these ideas come to life.
(but notify me so i can play the games, thanks)

--------------------------------------------------
"Full Gear"
Traditional turn-based hardcore roguelike... in steampunk style!
(Think of Skyrim's Dwemer Ruins style, but as a roguelike.)
- You are an engineer in a steam-powered dungeon, looking for the legendary Pepertuum Mobile that powers the entire dungeon
- Power up flamethrowers, steam-machines, frost blasters, high-pressure guns, and steam-powered mechs
- Fight both mechanical enemies (spiders, humanoids, snipers) and things from flesh and blood (cave goblins, dwarf engineers, human scientists)
- Only three floors, but they're all really big with multiple minibosses
- Use crazy gadgets like hourglasses, goggles, lockets, guns, pipes and hats
- Items have rarites that determine how good they are: Copper, Brass, Silver, Gold, Titanium

--------------------------------------------------------
"Geo"
You are an expert (with a Master's and PhD and all) geologist and geographer "Geo". You live on a (very big!) island named Shift Isle.
The name comes from the fact that, no matter how hard people try, the place is IMPOSSIBLE to map. Roads, buildings and even entire cities keep shifting...
You are on a study to gather all information, and finally make a complete map of the island. There's a large problem: nothing points in the right direction.
Satellite and plane pics: destroyed and/or invalid. Shift: never observed by anyone. You can never get high enough to see the while island yourself
with current technology either. Where do you even start?!

As it turns out... a lot of people are actually part of a giant conspiracy to keep Shift shifting. They have giant terraformers under the island,
that are capable of moving anything to anywhere. They check or the coast is clear, steer away anyone potentially watching, then move things off slowly.
High-ranked officials, geologists and other cartographers are all in on this, to keep tourists coming, recieve money from governments, and maybe even destroy things.
--------------------------------------------------
"Blitzkrieg"
Into the Breach, but with hexagons, heights, more mechs/enemies every turn, and only 3 turns.

it's not a ripoff! shut up!

--------------------------------------------------
Passive: Do whatever you want, they won't attack you ever. Cats, sheep, rocks.
Allied: They help you in battle! And won't backstab. Most of the time. Friends, teachers, escorts.
Friendly: Willing to give you help, but still easy to piss off. Local population.
Neutral: Not interested in any side. Might trade, might betray. Most traders and worksmen.
Fiended: Doesn't like you and won't give you stuff. Not always attacking. Local population when angered, and jealous people.
Hostile: When they see you, they'll try to harm you, guaranteed. Thieves, beasts, dragons?
Active: They actively hunt you down to kill you. The absolute worst. Bounty hunters, overlords, and general arch enemies.
--------------------------------------------------
A roguelike where everything seems normal: you need to escape a large complex, striking down enemies, finding gear, and reaching the final boss.
However, the more you play, the less people are willing to fight anymore. Even bosses try to talk to you instead.

At the end, after the final boss, you look in a mirror, and it turns out you're the lunatic that punched people until they simply fell down. A severe mental illness caused you to think that the entire world is against you, when in reality, you are against the entire world.

This is the worst idea on the list but still worth noting down i guess
--------------------------------------------------------
"CORE"

You are a famous researcher that's discovering the secrets of the Earth's core. Unfortunately, due to a bacteria, your entire team is sick. You've already had it though, so you decide to continue on the progress. The facility is almost empty, and while the many shafts of water/food supplies, mechanical wonders, and resources to power the whole thing are still manned, safety checks were a while ago...
You enter the extremely rapid lift to the first layer, Outer Shell.
The cable breaks!
Eh. Due to your extremely miraculous suit you're wearing, you fell for roughly 7 km, landing unharmed. But instead of deciding to go back, this is the ultimate excuse to finish the job: find the Inner Core!

You're equipped with a suit that completely protects you from heat as strong as the sun (nanobots or whatevs), some plasma guns, a strong water/food/electricity network all the way until the Outer Core, and a very weird personality that keeps talking to himself. Communication with the upper world is possible as long as there's a nearby Groundalite, the rock version of Satillites, working properly. Really nothing much to worry about.

Go through many different types of molten earth, find new curious creatures crawling out of the rocks, take pictures and use your strong drones to carry findings!
There's Outer Crust - Inner Crust - Outer Mantle - Inner Mantle - Outer Core - Inner Core (final boss)
The Inner Core is a giant ball of lava that kinda sorta contains a god. Very odd. You eventually, after many phases, beat him by turning him into stone by opening the Mariana Trench!
