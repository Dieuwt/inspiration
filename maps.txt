This is a text document that describes some hopefully good game ideas, inside (or outside) of Minecraft!
If you find this and you can make any of these come true, PLEASE do. I can't make everything myself but would love to see these ideas come to life.
(but notify me so i can play the games, thanks)

The Alchemists

Create custom potions that give effects and points!
You have to gather ingredients (and you can empty fields for others) to make potions.
You have a limited number of bottles (can be set per game); these are used for all brewing.
Cheating is possible: you can remove a potion earlier, add less ingredients, or add cheaper ones.
 This may get you caught by the Arch-Mage, but they do give the same amount of points...
 They may also give the wrong effects!
You get points based on how many potions you've made, and how well you've made them.

POTIONS
Classic - Brewing Stands, give normal effects (health, speed, strength)
Modern - Brewing Boxes, give special effects (glowing, luck, haste)
Ancient - Brewing Pots, give weird effects (vision, knowledge, stealth)

MODIFIERS
Life - some ingredients are quite dangerous to collect
Saturation - running around is very exhausting
Hydration - drinking potions restores a little, Water Bottles refill it
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Crystals: top-down action game (open-world?) where you have to collect Elemental Crystals to upgrade your wand
You need both the Spell and the Crystal to cast the spell
  Example: Fire Crystal lets you cast Firebolt, Flamethrower, Fireball etc
  	But you still need the books for that!

Fire, Earth, Water, Air
Life, Death, Lightning, Ice
Metal, Mystic, Light, Dark

TIME
Can manipulate the "fabric" of time. Stopping enemies or yourself in their tracks, reversing processes...
However, Time spells are fragile. Controlling the Fabric takes precision and care, and any misstep may break the spells.

ENERGY
Can activate any mechanism without any constraints. Light, electricity, movement...
But Energy exists in many forms. When not dealt with properly, they may turn into each other, and not give desirable outcomes.

MATTER
Can change the very substance of atoms. Turning metal into gold and weapons into food...
That having said, Matter is everywhere. Recklessy changing matter may target environment, friends, or even yourself by accident.

SOUL
Can control any living being. Illusions made real, powers weakened... soul ripped out means death.
Souls are extremely unstable when not in the right conditions. They cannot be easily controlled without the risk of instabilizing.

Everything consists out of etherium...
TIME is very, very weak etherium that flows through the entire universe. Each part itself is too weak to influence anything, but together they make the world move.
ENERGY is weak etherium that flows quickly or slowly through processes. They make things move or act as charged particles.
MATTER is concentrated etherium that manifests itself into atoms. The more concentrated, the heavier the element. This is an extremely stable form.
SOUL is very tight and concentrated etherium that's only stable when held together by sufficient energy and matter. It makes being sentient; when the stability is taken away, the Soul collapses into energy, also known as "Soul Split".
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"The Reset Button"
Loot, block/entity placement, and a lot of other things are random. There is a button hidden, the Reset Button, that resets and re-randomizes all loot.
The goal is to get the most points by doing something with the loot. Resetting gives you 10 points for free.
If you go too well, people might notice and reset, forcing you to rething your strategy...
The game ends after a certain amount of resets, like 5-10 or 10-20. How many? You don't find out until you're there. Spare your resets... or don't and hope you win with the reset points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Crossfire"
A map about crossbows! Collect arrows and valuable crossbows with different effects. Inflict arrows with special effects!

A few ideas for crossbows:
- [Air] Blowgun: launches you in the other direction you shot
- [Water] The Streamline: guide the arrows
- [Earth] Rock Smash: extra knockback. But heavy!
- [Ice] Frost Blast: shoots mutliple arrows that slow down
- [Lightning] Blitzkrieg: shoots very quickly, but with little power
- [Time] Clock Tock: allows you to stop arrows mid-air and let them continue on demand
- [Metal] Steel Storm: ???
- [Plant] Vine Wiper: shoot a vine that rapidly pulls you in
- [Force] 
- [Fire] The Crossfire: deals amazing damage, but sets you on fire!

Update: some bitch already took the name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Baby Steps"

A parkour map, but you don't play it. Instead, you make an AI that plays it for you.
Can be expanded with AI that doesn't know the jumps yet (machine learning!), frame-perfect jumps, turn-based parkour, competing AI's etc etc
Maybe even let players race the AI and see how long it takes for the computer to catch up.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"RAID"

RANDOM LARGE DUNGEON
NOT HARD DIFFICULTY
MANY ITEMS AND TREASURE
WEAPONS! ARMOR! CROSSBOWS! POTIONS!
KILL THE BOSS!

RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID!

(just a large fast-paced dungeon crawler. There is no right or wrong. Only chaos.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Something like Slay the Spire. Or just any card game. Card games are extremely underrepresented. They can't be THAT hard to make, right?
You can like do Mine cards, Craft cards, I don't know. Plenty of material to have fun with.
